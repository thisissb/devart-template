# Noise and Creative Cognition

## Description
Our project will gather tweets from the geolocation of the auditor plotting these on a google map so they can visually see the level of social noise in their auditorial sphere. We will then transform each message into a audio file that is broadcast around them to create a wall of sound to help their mind focus at an optimal 70dB. To make this journey each tweet must be read out via Google's text to speech, gathered on a central server and transmitted to Raspberry Pi's that are outfitted in tweet boxes with sound amplifiers.
