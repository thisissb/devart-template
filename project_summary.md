## Description
Our project will gather tweets from the geolocation of the auditor plotting these on a google map so they can visually see the level of social noise in their auditorial sphere. We will then transform each message into a audio file that is broadcast around them to create a wall of sound to help their mind focus at an optimal 70dB. To make this journey each tweet must be read out via Google's text to speech, gathered on a central server and transmitted to Raspberry Pi's that are outfitted in tweet boxes with sound amplifiers.

Thanks to James at The Milk Men for lending some space that already had SSL and stuff for our crazy coding marathon.
