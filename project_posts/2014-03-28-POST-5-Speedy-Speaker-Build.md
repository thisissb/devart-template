#SPEEDY SPEAKER BUILD

Sally just whipped this together. Thank goodness the local computer component place was not busy at lunch. She spun through like a tasmanian devil and collected the bits we needed to construct our miniature sound amplification system. At the moment this amplifier is connected to an audio source by 3.5mm headphone jack and powered by a set of batteries, in future it would be nice to integrate the sound chip into the raspberry pi on a more permanent basis.

For now there is one hour left so all hands on deck to prove the concept. I will post a video of the sound test if time permits.
