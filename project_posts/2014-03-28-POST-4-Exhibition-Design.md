#EXHIBITION DESIGN

![Birdhouse](project_images/tweetboxes.gif?raw=true "Birdhouse")

There are only two main components to the installation. A screen for input and the tweet boxes that house the Pi's and speaker units. Depending on the space we would approach the design in different ways.

##SQAURE SPACE
Ideally in a square space we could construct multiple tweet boxes that surround the user and submerge them in sound.

##RECTANGULAR SPACE
The design of the tweet boxes could be explored. We have illustrated them as birdhouses as they are an optimal shape to hold all the components and traditionally have a nice hole in the front which can act as the seat of our speakers. It only seems natural that tweets would come from the home of a bird.
