#THE ORGIN OF AN IDEA

In our day to day jobs we design and develop  - task that are by their nature creative and taxing on the brain. Every so often to aid a breakthrough we have to turn to the powerful internet for a bit of banal brain cleansing. Occasionally this is watching fail videos on YouTube or falling down the Rabbit hole that is reddit. More often that not it is checking Twitter for a digest of everything that is going on around us. We absorb information and let our brains take on the challenge we are facing in the background.

During one of these mental rests we came across a paper on the results from five experiments demonstrate that a bit of ambient noise enhances performance on creative tasks. The experiments focused on the differences between having a little sensory input versus having a constant background hum and how that effects the minds creative juices. No surprise we are more productive when our brain is stimulated by an ambient hum of about 70dB.

##PROJECT OVERVIEW
Our project will gather tweets from the geolocation of the auditor plotting these on a google map so they can visually see the level of social noise in their auditorial sphere. We will then transform each message into a audio file that is broadcast around them to create a wall of sound to help their mind focus at an optimal 70dB. To make this journey each tweet must be read out via Google's text to speech, gathered on a central server and transmitted to Raspberry Pi's that are outfitted in tweet boxes with sound amplifiers.
