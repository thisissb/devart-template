#TECHNICAL OVERVIEW

As outlined in the project description the technical set up is rather simple as it utilises lots of great API's and technologies. I have always responded to that old Jean-Luc Godard quote: “It's not where you take things from — it's where you take them to.”

I think this is really relevant in the world of digital design and art. There is no reasons to reinvent the wheel sometimes. If a bit of technology exist that you can use in a new way and improve on that is more exciting than starting form scratch. Art needs a familiarity it must be grounded in the relatable otherwise it doesn't resonate with people the same.


##Here is the technical roadmap 
User Inputs location > Google Map pin points that location > Twitter sends tweets within a given radius >
Tweets placed on map based on Geolocation > Tweets are stored in database > Database files are converted to sound files > Sound files are stored on the media server > Raspberry Pi media centre pick up files and plays in speaker boxes
