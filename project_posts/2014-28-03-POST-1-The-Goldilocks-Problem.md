So there are just under 11 hours to submit a project to Google DevArt to have the opportunity to exhibit at the awesome Barbican, what do we do?

"Well it is Friday so we could just pretend we didn't see this and take a long lunch?"

"Or we can build the most amazing project that we have always dreamed of. This is the Barbican. They are Google! The time is now."

"Why don't we do something amazing - that will be achievable"

This is the discussion that transpired in the past few hours between Sebastijan and myself. What an amazing opportunity we can't pass up, but what can we really do that hasn't been done before, is cool and something that really inspires us to shirk off our actual work and get something pulled together. 

After a few cups of coffee and furious sketching and debating we found an idea that was "just right". You can blame our neighbours for playing 90's dance music so loud it vibrates through our studio wall and the lack of crickets and birds chirping at the break of dawn on our journeys in. 

"This sounds like a good idea." - first pun of the day.

10 hours to go...
