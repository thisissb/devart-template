#SCIENCE OF SOUND

Sally grew up in the southern states of the USA. Every evening there you can hear cicadas chirping into the wee hours of the morning at times growing up she thought this noise would drive her insane, but upon moving to London she realised this sound was soothing - the heartbeat of nature that in a cooler climate was not there. 


Sally's hometown is also the birth place of rock n' roll music so she has always had a unique relationship with music. "turn that racket down" was never uttered by her parents but that was probably to do with the fact that the family run recording studio was just as loud. 

There has always been a unique distinction between music or sound and noise. Noise is considered negative - something that you want to avoid. If you type noise into google the first results description states "Noise means any unwanted sound." But in most cases a light hum of noise is better that sound - or even a lack there of.

There is a really interesting article about the effects of ambient noise on brain functioning in the Chicago Journal

TLDR - It is like when you are at a party - if no one is talking it is awkward and you feel uncomfortable and you just don't function in that social setting. If the bass is up loud on the stereo and people are clinking glasses and rattling maracas - you get stressed you can't communicate with your friends you shout at the top of your lungs to get over the den of racket only to go horse by the end of the evening and leave with ringing in your ears. 

Sometimes though you are at a party and the music is at the right level people are chatting back and forth and things are calm. You can function in this social environment and you can hear yourself think, but your thoughts aren't louder than the room.

When laid out it is pretty common sense.
